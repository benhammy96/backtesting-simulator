# Backtesting Simulator

## Overview

This project simulates trading strategies using synthetic data to evaluate performance metrics such as Time-Weighted Average Price and Volume-Weighted Average Price. It provides insights into execution costs and slippage, aiding in the assessment of trading strategies.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creates simulated price and volume data to mimic real-world trading scenarios.
- **TWAP Execution:** Implements the TWAP strategy by averaging prices over specified time intervals.
- **VWAP Calculation:** Computes the VWAP by considering both price and volume, offering a weighted average price.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate execution costs and slippage to assess strategy effectiveness.
- **Visualization:** Plots price movements over time for visual analysis.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
